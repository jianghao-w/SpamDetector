# SpamDetector
This project explores a series of ML/DL/LLM approach for detecting spam messages 

## 1. SVM Filter
The first spam filter implementation employs Support Vector Machine (SVM) Machine Learning model. In this project, I explore several optional model settings for SVM, including Linear Support Vector Classifier, SVC using Linear Kernal, SVC using Stochastic Gradient Descent, and compare them to Multinomial Naive Bayes. The results shows that LinearSVC has the best accuracy, at same time outperfoms other models in terms of running time too.
